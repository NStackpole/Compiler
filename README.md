# Compiler Design Repository
This repository holds work done for my Compiler Design class. Currently that includes a compiler being made for a language designed in the class. Currently the "compiler" is really just a C++ library representation of the abstract syntax tree for the language.

This language currently:
* Can evaluate boolean expressions
* Has a very basic type system
