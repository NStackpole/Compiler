# Compiler Design Repository
This repository holds work done for my Compiler Design class. Currently that includes a compiler being made for a language designed in the class. Currently the "compiler" is really just a C++ library representation of the abstract syntax tree for the language.

This language currently:
* Can evaluate the following expressions : Not, And, Or, Xor, Conditional, <, >, ==. 
* Has a very basic type system: integer and boolean.

TODO:
* Implement type checking
* Implement the evaluation of the following expressions : <=, >=, !=, division, modulus, negation, multiplication, subtraction, addition, and then (&&), or else (||).
